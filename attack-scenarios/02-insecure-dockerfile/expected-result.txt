Expected Behavior:
==================

Conftest should detect and reject the following issues in Dockerfile.insecure:

1. ❌ Using 'latest' tag for base image
2. ❌ Running as root user
3. ❌ Missing USER instruction
4. ❌ apt-get without --no-install-recommends
5. ❌ No apt-get clean after install
6. ⚠️  Missing HEALTHCHECK (warning)
7. ⚠️  Copying entire directory (warning)

The secure Dockerfile should pass all critical checks.

Exit Code: 0 (test passes when insecure Dockerfile is rejected)
